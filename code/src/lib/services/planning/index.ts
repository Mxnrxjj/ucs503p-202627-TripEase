/**
 * The planning entry point: AI proposes, TripEase validates, and the
 * deterministic planner catches everything that falls through.
 *
 *   attempt → Zod → constraint checks → (one repair retry) → fallback
 *
 * Exactly one retry, and only when the failure is something a model can
 * plausibly fix (a bad allocation, malformed JSON) — never for auth/quota/
 * timeouts, where retrying just costs money and time. Whatever happens, this
 * returns a valid plan: the traveller never sees a broken generation screen
 * because a model had an off day.
 *
 * This function knows nothing about Groq, OpenAI or any other vendor; it
 * depends only on the `AIProvider` interface.
