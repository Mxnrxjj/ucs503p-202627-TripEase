/**
 * The planner that runs when there's no AI configured, or when the AI's
 * answer doesn't survive validation. It must never fail and never invent.
 *
 * Two cases:
 *
 * 1. A curated destination (currently Thailand) has a known-good city split,
 *    so the demo keeps its hand-tuned Bangkok/Phuket quality.
 * 2. Anything else stays in one place named after the destination itself.
 *    Earlier iterations split unknown destinations into "<Destination> City"
 *    and "<Destination> Coast", which read like real cities but weren't —
 *    that's exactly the fabrication this planner has to avoid. Choosing real
 *    cities for an arbitrary country is a reasoning job; without the AI we
 *    don't guess, we just don't split.
